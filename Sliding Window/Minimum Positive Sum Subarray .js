/* 
You are given an integer array nums and two integers l and r. Your task is to find the minimum sum of a subarray whose size is between l and r (inclusive) and whose sum is greater than 0.

Return the minimum sum of such a subarray. If no such subarray exists, return -1.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3, -2, 1, 4], l = 2, r = 3
Output: 1
Explanation:
The subarrays of length between l = 2 and r = 3 where the sum is greater than 0 are:
[3, -2] with a sum of 1
[1, 4] with a sum of 5
[3, -2, 1] with a sum of 2
[-2, 1, 4] with a sum of 3
Out of these, the subarray [3, -2] has a sum of 1, which is the smallest positive sum. Hence, the answer is 1.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-2, 2, -3, 1], l = 2, r = 3
Output: -1
Explanation:
There is no subarray of length between l and r that has a sum greater than 0. So, the answer is -1.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], l = 2, r = 4
Output: 3
Explanation:
The subarray [1, 2] has a length of 2 and the minimum sum greater than 0. So, the answer is 3.
